## Cloud Concepts
### What is Cloud Computing
* Cloud computing: the practive of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
* On premise:
  * You own the servers
  * You hire the IT people
  * Your pay or rent the real-estate
  * You take all the risk
* Cloud Providers
  * Someone else owns the servers
  * Someone else hires the IT people
  * Someone else pays or rents the real-estate
  * You are responsible for your configuring cloud services and code, someone else takes care of the rest.

### Six advantages and benefits of Cloud Computing *
#### Why go with a Cloud Provicer over On-Premise?
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
   * <b>No Upfront costs</b>: instead of paying for data centers and servers
   * Pay On-Demand: Pay only when you consume computing resources
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
   * Usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated in the cloud. You are sharing the cost with other customers to get unbeatable savings
3. Stop guessing capacity
    * Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs. Instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers, you can scale up or down to meet the current need.
4. Increase speed and agility
    * Launch resources within a few clicks in minutes Instead of waiting days or weeks for your IT to implement the solution on-premise 
5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
    * <b>Focus on your own customers</b> rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers
6. Go global in minutes
    * Deploy your app in <b>multiple regions around the world with a few clicks.</b> provide lower latency and a better experience for yor customers at minimal cost.

### Types of Cloud Computing
* <b>SaaS Software as a service</b> (for Customers)
    * A completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
    * Don't worry about how the service is maintained. It just works and remains available. 
    * ex: gmail, salesforce, office 365
* <b>PaaS Platform as a service</b> (for Developers)
  * Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure. Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
  * Don't worry about provisioning, configuring or understanding the hardware or OS
  * heroku
  * Elastic beanstalk
  * Engines for google
* <b>IaaS Infrastructure as a service</b> (for Admins)
  * The basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space
  * Don't worry about IT staff, data centers and hardware
  * AWS
  * GCP
  * Azure

## Cloud Computing Deployment Models
* **Cloud**: Fully utiliing cloud computing
  * Startups
  * SaaS offerings
  * New projects and companies
  * Ex: dropbox, squarespace
* **Hybrid**: Using both Cloud and On-Premise
  * Banks
  * FinTech, Investment Management
  * Large Professional Service providers
  * Legacy on-premise
  * Ex: Deloitte, CIBC, CPP
* **On-Premise**: Deployment resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools. Sometimes called "private cloud".
  * Public Sector e.g. Government
  * Super sensitive data e.g. hospitals
  * Large enterprise with heavy regulation e.g. insurance companies
